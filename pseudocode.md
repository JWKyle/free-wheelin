Project "Free Wheelin'" is a program that takes the amount of free time you have in between commitments (meetings, family time, etc) and figures out a place you can ride your bike to.  

In the UI, we'll need the user to input:
    **For the ride:**
        Amount of time available
        The kind of ride they want to go on (leisurely, moderate, workout, custom)
        How much time they'd like for a buffer zones (includes time to get onto bike, and possible shower time afterward)
        Amount of time at the location       
    **Future Ride Setups:**
        Places/landmarks they'd like to visit to be added to the list
    **View the List of Destinations**
        View the table
    **Show the starting address for verification**
        Possibly allow for option of new starting destination?
